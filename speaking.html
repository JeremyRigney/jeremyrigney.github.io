							Throughout my academic journey, particularly during my PhD, I have been deeply involved in science communication, sharing my research and expertise with a wide range of audiences. I have presented at professional conferences, delivered invited seminars, and given engaging talks to astronomical societies, as well as to college and professional groups. These experiences have allowed me to communicate complex scientific ideas effectively to diverse audiences, from experts in the field to members of the general public. Having spoken to thousands of people in various settings, I have developed the ability to tailor my presentations to different levels of expertise, ensuring clarity and accessibility while maintaining scientific rigor. 
							</p>
							<p style='width:90%; margin: 0px auto; margin-bottom:10px;'>
							My dedication to public speaking and science communication has been recognized through several prestigious awards. In 2022, I received the Peter Curran Award for Best Postgraduate Presentation at the Irish National Astronomy Meeting. In 2024, I was honored with the Rosse Medal for Best Postgraduate Presentation at the Institute of Physics Ireland Spring Conference, which qualified me for the IOP Three Minute Wonder UK and Ireland Final at the historic Royal Institution in London. At this competition, I was delighted to win the Audience Vote Award for my presentation.

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pintofscience_square.png" alt=""/></span>Pint of Science aims to bring local science to a local audience in the fun and relaxing environment of a local pub! I led the organisation of a Pint of Science event in the Chestnut Pub in Birr, Ireland in 2024. Three speakers were recruited to talk on a wide range of topics from black holes, radio astronomy and coffee as a treatment for dementia to local ecology and biodiversity. I acted as the host for the evening, with introductions for each of the speakers and a fun pub quiz for the audience with questions related to each of the speaker topics. It was an ecxceelent opportunity to engage with a cohort of the general public who may not be comfortable attending more traditional, formal public science events!</p>

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/IOP_3MW.jpg" alt="" /></span>Having won the best postgraduate presentation at the IOP Spring conference in March, I qualified for the final of the Three Minute Wonder competition. Three Minute Wonder is an IOP competition run yearly across Ireland and the UK. The aim is to present a research topic to a general audience in three minutes, with only one slide and the option of using props. The final was held in the <a href='https://venue.rigb.org/our-spaces/theatre' target='_blank'>historic Theatre at the Royal Institution</a>. 8 finalists from across the UK and Ireland presented our research to the full auditorium. My presentation won the Audience Vote Award, chosen by the over 200 members of the public in attendance. It was an incredible end to a brilliant competition.</p>
